The optional slide rail kit X9267A, backward-compatible with X9274A is designed to enable Sun Fire V20z servers to be racked in a Sun Rack 1000-38 also known as Sun Rack 1038 and third party EIA 310D compliant racks which have mounting depths of 27-30 inches. Please note that not all third party racks meet these parameters. The slides are usable on racks with a rail-to-rail spacing of 26.88-30.63 inches. The Sun Rack 1038 rail spacing, for example, is 27.00 inches. The slide kit will include hardware that enables mounting to any of the following types of rack rails: 6 mm threaded holes #10-32 threaded holes #10 clearance holes The optional slide rail kit X9267A is a 4-point mounted slide rail kit only. No other kits will be available to allow 2-point, front-mount, nor mid-mount configuration.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","Back, below power supply","April 2004","","Patch Readmes and Downloads Boot PROM and LOM Revisions","Warranty Information","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","One Slim-line ATAPI DVD-ROM/Floppy or CD-ROM/Floppy optional","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Oracle Lifetime Support Policy for Hardware","32-Bit: Solaris 9 x86 4/04 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 AMD64 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 AMD64 Microsoft Windows 2000 WHCL-certified Microsoft Windows Server 2003 WHCL-certified 64-Bit: Solaris 10 x86 SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 8 AMD64 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 AMD64 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 AMD64","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","A55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Information Areas Hardware Specifications System Views and Components Full Components List Information Center Problem Resolution How To Troubleshooting Alerts 0 Reference 0 Related Documentation Quick Facts Family part # A55 Serial Number Location Back, below power supply FRU Number Location Between CD drive and Fan #6,under top skin Rack Units 1 GA Date April 2004 Service Life Oracle Lifetime Support Policy for Hardware Minimum SupportedOperating Environment Versions 32-Bit: Solaris 9 x86 4/04 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 AMD64 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 AMD64 Microsoft Windows 2000 WHCL-certified Microsoft Windows Server 2003 WHCL-certified 64-Bit: Solaris 10 x86 SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 8 AMD64 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 AMD64 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 AMD64 Patch Information Patch Readmes and Downloads Boot PROM and LOM Revisions Warranty Warranty Information Quick Facts Family part # A55 Serial Number Location Back, below power supply FRU Number Location Between CD drive and Fan #6,under top skin Rack Units 1 GA Date April 2004 Service Life Oracle Lifetime Support Policy for Hardware Minimum SupportedOperating Environment Versions 32-Bit: Solaris 9 x86 4/04 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 AMD64 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 AMD64 Microsoft Windows 2000 WHCL-certified Microsoft Windows Server 2003 WHCL-certified 64-Bit: Solaris 10 x86 SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 8 AMD64 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 AMD64 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 AMD64 Patch Information Patch Readmes and Downloads Boot PROM and LOM Revisions Warranty Warranty Information","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Between CD drive and Fan #6,under top skin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
